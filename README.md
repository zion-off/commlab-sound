# Sound 

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

Our sound assignment consists of a simulated flight from Abu Dhabi to New York, in which the user is the pilot. The focus of the experience is the sound. The user will get instructions from the control tower, and must follow the instructions. An example being "prepare for take off", where the user must press the take off button which will be indicated on the screen. There are noises simulated, such as flight attendants speaking and controls from the control center.  


## PROCESS 

Our group decided to split the work amongst ourselves. Tengis and Zion worked in the code, while Hind and Arslan worked on the sounds. 

I worked on the sounds, I recorded all the sounds (flight attendant) and edited them on Audacity. Alongside this, I also edited the sounds recorded by Arslan. I utilized the Filter Curve EQ effect on Audacity to make the audio sound like it is coming through an intercom, and added the beginning to simulate an announcement on a plane. 

## REFLECTION 

Our project did work out like we intended, it ultimately  simulated a flight and was very enjoyable to experience. I believe it truly encompassed a flight experience, and we hope the users enjoy it.
